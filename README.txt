This is the complete project folder for the app I built in Android Studio as part of an Android 
Development class taken my senior year at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.

The app was designed to help individuals manage their college applications. It is not fully realized,
as it was built during the second half of a semester and I confess that building apps is not my primary
passion. You can watch a video of the app working here: https://youtu.be/FcBybFw86yU  

However, it did give me a chance to begin to learn SQL, something I continued to learn in the Web 
Development class I took the next semester. SQL is one of the skills I am also focused on greatly 
enhancing this summer (2020).
